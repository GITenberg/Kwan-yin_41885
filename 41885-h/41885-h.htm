<p>&#8268; THE TEMPLE OF KWAN-YIN, GODDESS OF MERCY. <span class="red">A wide altar occupies
the whole of the back of the stage; a long fringe of strips of yellow
brocade hangs from the ceiling to within 3 feet of the floor at either
end of the altar. In the centre of the altar the seated figure of the
goddess is vaguely visible in the dimness; only the face is definitely
seen&mdash;a golden face; the expression is passionless and aloof. A long
table about 12 inches lower than the altar stands in front of it, right
across the stage. On the table, before the feet of Kwan-yin, is her
carved tablet with her name in golden characters on a red lacquer
ground. In front of the tablet is a large brass bowl full of joss-sticks
the smoke of which wavers in the air &amp; occasionally obscures the face of
Kwan-yin. There are several plates of waxen looking fruit &amp; cakes on the
table &amp; two horn lanterns&mdash;these are the only light in the scene. On
either side of Kwan-yin, between the table and the altar, there is a
pillar with a gilded wooden dragon twisted round it, head downward. To
the left, forward, is a large barrel-shaped drum slung on a carved
blackwood stand.</span></p>

<p class="red">Four priests &amp; two acolytes are seen like shadows before this palely lit
background. One acolyte to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> right of the table beats a little hoarse
bell. This he does during the course of the whole scene, in the
following rhythm:&mdash;7-8-20-7-8-20. He should reach the 105th beat at the
end of the second hymn to Kwan-yin. The other acolyte stands by the drum
and beats it softly at irregular intervals as indicated. The acolytes
are little boys in long blue coats. The four priests stand at the table
with their faces toward Kwan-yin; their robes are pale dull pink silk
with a length of deeper apricot pink draped about the shoulders.</p>

<p class="p2 red">The priests kneel and kow-tow to Kwan-yin.</p>

<p class="red">The acolytes sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The voice of pain is weak and thin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Kwan-yin&mdash;Kwan-yin....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First priest&mdash;tenor&mdash;chants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is she then a warrior against sin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what field does she plant her banner?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears she a sword?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First and second priests&mdash;tenor and bass&mdash;chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world is very full of battle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speared and plumed forests in their ranks besiege the mountains;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The flooded fields like scimitars lie between the breasts of the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists ride on bugling winds down the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not Kwan-yin bear a sword?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">Third priest&mdash;tenor&mdash;chants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin is no warrior.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin bears no sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even against sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin has no battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is her banner&mdash;a new day, a forgetting hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hands are empty of weapons and outstretched to the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her feet are set on lotus flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lotus flowers are set on a pale lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lake is filled with the tears of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin is still, she is very still, she listens always,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin lives remembering tears.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">At this point the smoke of the joss-sticks veils the face of Kwan-yin. A
woman's voice sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore remember tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tears be dried by remembrance?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">This voice is apparently not heard by the priests and acolytes.</p>

<p class="red">First and third priests chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, Kwan-yin, mother of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those in pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who are held fast in pain of their own or another's seeking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those for whom the world is too difficult<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And too beautiful to bear,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First and third priests:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those who are blind, who shall never read the writing upon the fierce rivers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall never see the slow flowing of the stars from mountain to mountain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who are deaf, whom music and the fellowship of words have forsaken<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">First and third priests:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those whose love is buried and broken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All those under the sun who lack the thing that they love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under the moon cry out because of their lack,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First priest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh thou taker away of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou taker away of tears....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The smoke quivers across Kwan-yin's face again, and the same woman's
voice sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore remember the desolate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there a road of escape out of the unending wilderness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can Kwan-yin find a way where there is no way?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">Still the voice is unheard by the worshippers. First priest sings, and
while he sings the acolyte beats the drum softly at quick irregular
intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin shall come, shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely she shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring content and a new diamond day to the desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring the touch of hands &amp; the song of birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who walk terribly alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To part the russet earth and the fingers of the leaves in the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they may give up their treasure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who faint for lack of such treasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen to the long complaining of the old and the unwanted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring lover to lover across the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrusting the stars aside and cleaving the seas and the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold up the high paths beneath the feet of travellers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the persuading roar of waters from the ears of the broken-hearted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring a smile to the narrow lips of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make beautiful the eyes of death.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">A woman's voice again sings, unheeded, from behind the veil of smoke.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore plead with death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall soften the terrible heart of death?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All, in urgent but slow unison:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The golden face of Kwan-yin above the altar changes suddenly and
terribly, and becomes like a masque of fear. The lanterns flare
spasmodically. The voice can now be identified as Kwan-yin's, but still
the priests stand unhearing with their heads bowed, and still the
passionless bell rings.</p>

<p class="red">Kwan-yin, in a screaming voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, be still, be still....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am Mercy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy is defeated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy who battled not, is defeated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is a captive bound to the chariot of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow has set his foot upon her neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin has mocked her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn away thine eyes from Mercy,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From poor Mercy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woo her no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry upon her no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">There is an abrupt moment of silence as the light becomes dim again &amp;
Kwan-yin's face is frozen still. Then the first priest sings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What then are Mercy's gifts? The rose-red slopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hills ... the secret twisted hands of trees?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not the moon &amp; the stars redeem lost hopes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fairer gifts shall Mercy bring than these?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, in the end, when our beseeching clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies with our bells; when fear devours our words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, she shall come &amp; hold the night with glamor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, she shall come &amp; sow the dawn with birds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah thou irrelevant saviour, ah thou bringer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of treasure from the empty sky, ah thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who answerest death with song, shall such a singer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be silent now? Shall thou be silent now?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The 105th beat of the bell is now reached and there is a pause in the
ringing.</p>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">KWAN-YIN.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">The bell is rung slowly three times. Then there is absolute silence.
There is now a tenseness in the attitudes of all the worshippers, they
lean forward and look with suspense into Kwan-yin's quite impassive
golden face.</p>

<p class="red">The lights go out suddenly.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
